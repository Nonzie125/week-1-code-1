Transaction Tracker is a React application that allows users to manage their financial transactions.
It was inspired by the need to use simple transaction management tools
Users can add new transactions, search through existing transactions, and view all transactions in a table format.
This app is designed in a way that one can 
                      View all Transactions: See a table of all transactions.
                      Add Transaction: Fill out and submit a form to add a new transaction.
                      Search Transactions by Filtering transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term will be shown in the transactions table.
                      It can also sort Transactions alphabetically by category or description.
                      Also can delete Transaction from table

This app has been designed with React and json-server.
